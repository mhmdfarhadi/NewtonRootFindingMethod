this is a matlab code for root finding using Newton method 
this function will be called by "NewtonMethod"
NewtonMethod function wiil request 5 given input as [initial guess, tolerance, maximum iterations, input function, variable]
and has 3 output [final answer, number of iterations it took to reach tolerance or maximum iterations, a matrix of final answer and f(x) and f'(x) for each iteration]
